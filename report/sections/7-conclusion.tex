For the redaction of this report, I would like to acknowledge the use of artificial intelligence to improve
the clarity and structure of my sentences. The core observations, analyses, and personal reflections
are entirely my own, drawn from my experiences during the field trip and subsequent research. The
LLM usage was employed primarily for language refinement, code formatting, and orthographic corrections.
Its integration helped communicate complex concepts clearly and effectively.
