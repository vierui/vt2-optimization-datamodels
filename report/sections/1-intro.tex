\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context \& Motivation}
% Rising share of renewables â†’ need for integrated planning and short-term forecasting
% TODO: Write about:
% - Energy-system planning challenges
% - Why multi-year, multi-season optimization matters
% - Rising renewable penetration requiring integrated planning
% - Need for short-term forecasting capabilities

\subsection{VT1 Recaps}
% DC-power-flow LP prototype; static demand; manual scenario handling, solver, key data flows
% TODO: Write about:
% - DC-power-flow LP prototype characteristics
% - Static demand assumptions
% - Manual scenario handling approach
% - Solver and key data flows
% - System architecture and limitations

\subsubsection{Bottlenecks}
% TODO: Write about:
% - Performance bottlenecks in VT1
% - Areas where VT1 was slow
% - Investment logic misrepresentations
% - Specific problems that motivated VT2 development

\subsection{Goals}
% (i) migrate optimisation core from LP to MILP with realistic unit-commitment and investment decisions
% (ii) add data-driven PV/Wind forecasting to feed the optimiser
% (iii) consolidate codebase (Poetry + tests) -> Not a goal but genuinely improved
% TODO: Write about:
% - Goal (i): Migrate optimization core from LP to MILP
% - Realistic unit-commitment and investment decisions
% - Goal (ii): Add data-driven PV/Wind forecasting
% - Integration of forecasting to feed the optimizer
% - Goal (iii): Consolidate codebase (Poetry + tests)
% - Code quality improvements and testing infrastructure
