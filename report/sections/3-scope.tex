\section{Problem Definition and Scope}

This project extends the first-year LP framework in two directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MILP investment-dispatch model} – replaces the single-year LP with a multi-year 
    mixed-integer formulation that chooses both what to build and how to run it, so CAPEX and 
    OPEX are minimised in one pass.
    \item \textbf{Independent ML forecasting module} – delivers day-ahead predictions of the 
    exogenous time series (load and variable renewables). It is stand-alone for now but provides 
    the data that a rolling short-term optimisation would need.
\end{itemize}

This section outlines what is inside the study, what stays outside, and which indicators we will track.

\subsection{Planning Horizon and System Boundaries}

The scope of the study is defined by several key elements:

\textbf{Strategic horizon:} The model considers a user-defined list of years, normally between 1 and 10. 
This allows the optimisation to capture the timing of asset builds and retirements.

\textbf{Operational resolution:} Each year is represented by three typical weeks (winter, summer, 
spring-autumn). This approach keeps the MILP size modest while preserving essential seasonal detail.

\textbf{Forecast horizon:} The main forecasting target is 24 hours ahead, with additional checks at 48, 72, and 168 hours. This aligns with day-ahead operational needs and allows us to observe how forecast quality degrades with longer horizons.

\textbf{Network footprint:} The optimisation is run on a fixed test grid, including buses, lines, and assets. This lets us attribute changes in results to the model itself, not to changes in the underlying data.

Everything behind the connection point, as well as retail tariffs and ancillary services, is excluded from the study.

\subsection{Decision Variables and Constraints}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
$b_{g,y},\;b_{s,y}$ & binary & new -- build decisions for generators $g$ and storage $s$ \\
$u_{g,y,t}$ & binary & new -- on / off for thermal generators \\
$p_{g,y,s,t}$ & continuous & carried over -- dispatch per generator \\
$p^{\text{ch}}_{s,y,s,t},\;p^{\text{dis}}_{s,y,s,t}$ & continuous & carried over -- storage charge, discharge \\
$e_{s,y,s,t}$ & continuous & carried over -- state of charge \\
$f_{l,y,s,t}$ & continuous & carried over -- DC line flow \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

New or changed constraint families include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Build--lifetime link:} Sums of $b_{g,y}$ or $b_{s,y}$ set the installed flag for each year and forbid overlapping rebuilds.
    \item \textbf{Unit commitment:} Minimum up/down times, start costs, and ramp limits are tied to $u_{g,y,t}$.
    \item \textbf{CAPEX annuity:} Annual cost terms are based on build binaries and a capital recovery factor.
    \item \textbf{Storage relaxed final SoC:} The end-of-week state of charge may float within 10\% of capacity to speed up the solve.
\end{itemize}

All other LP constraints—such as power balance, line limits, storage energy balance, and renewable profiles—remain in place, but now reference the new binary variables where needed.
These elements turn the LP into a MILP, giving the solver the freedom to co-optimise when to invest and how to operate.

\subsection{Forecast Horizon and Accuracy Targets}

The forecasting module generates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary target} -- 24 hourly values for the next day for each time series.
    \item \textbf{Additional checks} -- 48 h, 72 h and 7-day horizons to stress-test model degradation.
    \item \textbf{Features} -- calendar flags, recent lags, rolling means, simple weather proxies.
    \item \textbf{Models} -- linear baseline, random forest, gradient boosting, LSTM; all treated with identical split and scaling rules.
\end{itemize}

Accuracy targets (set after an initial back-test):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Day-ahead target} \\
\hline
MAE & $< 5\%$ of mean load \\
RMSE & $< 7\%$ of mean load \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Longer horizons have looser bands, logged but not optimised against.

\subsection{Key Performance Indicators}

The following indicators are tracked to assess the value of the MILP and the forecasting module:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cost:} Total discounted system cost, including CAPEX annuities and weighted OPEX, is the main optimisation objective.
    \item \textbf{Solver:} MILP wall-clock time and optimality gap are reported for each run.
    \item \textbf{Forecast:} MAE and RMSE are tracked for each horizon and time series; lower values are better.
    \item \textbf{Robustness:} The number of hours with unmet demand or line overload is monitored and should be zero.
    \item \textbf{Transparency:} The share of total cost by asset class is reported to support sensitivity analysis.
\end{itemize}
