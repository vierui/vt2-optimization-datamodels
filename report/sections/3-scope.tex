\section{Problem Definition and Scope}

\subsection{Planning Horizon and System Boundaries}
% TODO: Write about:
% - Multi-year planning horizon definition
% - System boundaries and geographical scope
% - Temporal resolution and seasonal representation
% - Which aspects are excluded (AC power flow, real-time trading, etc.)
% - Justification for exclusions and scope limitations

\subsection{Decision Variables and Constraints}
% Investment binaries, UC binaries, storage SOC, DC flows
% TODO: Write about:
% - Investment binary variables for capacity expansion
% - Unit commitment binary variables for operational decisions
% - Storage state of charge (SOC) variables
% - DC power flow variables
% - Constraint formulations and mathematical relationships

\subsection{Forecast Horizon and Accuracy Targets}
% TODO: Write about:
% - Short-term forecasting horizon definition
% - Accuracy targets for different forecast types
% - Integration of forecasts with optimization model
% - Uncertainty handling and scenario generation
% - Forecast update frequency and rolling horizon approach

\subsection{KPIs}
% Total cost, MILP solve time, forecast MAE/RMSE.
% TODO: Write about:
% - Total system cost metrics
% - MILP solve time performance indicators
% - Forecast accuracy metrics (MAE/RMSE)
% - Investment decision quality measures
% - Operational efficiency indicators
