create_master_load.py

Creates master_load.csv with columns:
    time, bus, pd, season

For each season (winter, summer, autumn_spring):
  - Bus 5 uses load data from the same week as the season range.
  - Bus 6 uses load data from the *following* week, then time-shifts it 
    so it aligns with the seasonâ€™s date range.

Example:
  If 'winter' is 2023-01-08 -> 2023-01-14,
    - bus 5 loads = 2023-01-08 -> 2023-01-14 (from load-2023.csv)
    - bus 6 loads = 2023-01-15 -> 2023-01-21 (from load-2023.csv), 
      but time-shifted 7 days backward so final times still show 2023-01-08 -> 2023-01-14
